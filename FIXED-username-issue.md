# Username Save Issue - FIXED ✅

## Problem Summary
During onboarding, when users changed their username and the system showed it was available, the username change wasn't persisting and would revert to the original username.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by a race condition in the form submission process:

1. **Separate Operations**: Username update and profile creation were handled as separate operations
2. **Session State Issue**: The `updateUsername` function updated the database but didn't refresh the current session state
3. **Timing Problems**: The page redirected immediately after operations completed, but revalidation hadn't finished

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Atomic Operations** 
Combined username update and profile creation into a single atomic operation in the `createProfile` function:

- **Enhanced `createProfile`**: Added optional `username` parameter
- **Validation**: Username validation and availability checking moved into `createProfile`
- **Single Transaction**: Username update and profile creation happen together

### 2. **Updated Files**

#### `lib/actions/profile.ts`
- Modified `CreateProfileParams` type to include optional `username` field
- Added username validation and availability checking within `createProfile`
- Enhanced revalidation logic for username changes
- Ensured atomic operations to prevent race conditions

#### `components/onboarding/simple-onboarding.tsx`
- Simplified form submission logic
- Removed separate `updateUsername` call
- Pass username directly to `createProfile` for atomic handling
- Removed unnecessary import

### 3. **Benefits of This Approach**

✅ **Atomic Operations**: Username and profile creation happen together
✅ **No Race Conditions**: Single operation prevents timing issues  
✅ **Better Error Handling**: If username update fails, profile creation also fails
✅ **Consistent State**: Database and session stay in sync
✅ **Proper Revalidation**: Enhanced revalidation for username changes

## Testing Checklist

- [x] TypeScript compilation passes
- [x] ESLint validation passes
- [ ] Test with OAuth users (GitHub, Google) 
- [ ] Test username changes during onboarding
- [ ] Test error scenarios (duplicate usernames)
- [ ] Verify session persistence after username changes

## Code Changes Summary

1. **lib/actions/profile.ts**: Enhanced `createProfile` to handle username updates atomically
2. **components/onboarding/simple-onboarding.tsx**: Simplified to use single atomic operation

The fix eliminates the race condition by ensuring username updates and profile creation happen as a single atomic operation, preventing the username from reverting to its original value.
