# Username Display and Portfolio Link Fix

## Issue Description

After changing username during onboarding, two problems occurred:
1. **Admin Sidebar**: The new username was not showing on the admin sidebar
2. **Portfolio Link**: The "View your portfolio" link was still pointing to the old username

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was caused by **session caching** in the Better Auth system:

1. **Session Caching**: The auth system has cookie caching enabled (5-minute cache), so session data wasn't immediately updated after username changes
2. **Admin Layout Dependency**: The admin layout was using `session.user.username` directly instead of fresh database data
3. **Stale Data**: Even with revalidation, the cached session data was still being used

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Admin Layout Data Source Fix (`app/(admin)/layout.tsx`)

**Before**: Used cached session data for username
```typescript
// Potentially stale session data
userUsername: session.user.username || "",
```

**After**: Use fresh database data for username
```typescript
// Always use fresh DB data for username
userUsername: userData.username || "",
```

**Changes Made**:
- Moved username validation to use database data: `if (!userData.username)`
- Prioritized database user data over session data for all user fields
- Added fallbacks to session data only when database data is not available

### 2. Enhanced Revalidation (`lib/utils/revalidation.ts`)

**Added admin layout revalidation** to both functions:

- `revalidateUserProfile()`: Added `revalidatePath("/admin")`
- `revalidateUsernameChange()`: Added `revalidatePath("/admin")`

This ensures that when usernames change, the admin layout cache is properly invalidated.

### 3. Documentation (`components/onboarding/simple-onboarding.tsx`)

Added clarifying comment:
```typescript
router.refresh(); // Refresh to ensure admin layout gets updated session data
```

## Technical Details

### Session vs Database Data Priority

The fix establishes this priority order for user data in admin layout:
1. **Username**: Always from database (most critical for accuracy)
2. **Name**: Database first, fallback to session
3. **Email**: Database first, fallback to session

### Cache Invalidation Flow

1. Username change in onboarding → `createProfile()` action
2. Database updated with new username
3. Enhanced revalidation invalidates:
   - User profile caches
   - Username-specific caches  
   - **Admin layout cache** (newly added)
4. Admin layout refetches fresh data from database

## Result

✅ **Admin sidebar now shows updated username immediately**  
✅ **Portfolio link correctly points to new username**  
✅ **Session caching no longer causes stale data issues**

## Files Modified

- `app/(admin)/layout.tsx` - Use database data instead of session data
- `lib/utils/revalidation.ts` - Enhanced cache invalidation
- `components/onboarding/simple-onboarding.tsx` - Added documentation

The fix ensures that username changes are immediately reflected in the admin interface without requiring manual page refreshes or waiting for session cache expiration.
